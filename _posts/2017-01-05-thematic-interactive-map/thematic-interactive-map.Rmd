```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Last week all the _rstatsosphere_ see the beautiful 
[Timo Grossenbacher](https://timogrossenbacher.ch)
[work](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2016/12/beautiful-thematic-maps-with-ggplot2-only/).

The last month, yep, the past year I've working on create maps
easily with [highcharter](http://jkunst.com/highcharter/).
When I saw this chart I took as  challege to replicate this nice
 map in using highcharter:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure from https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2016/12/beautiful-thematic-maps-with-ggplot2-only/", out.extra="class=external"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://timogrossenbacher.ch/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tm-final-map-1-1.png")
```

So...

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rmapshaper)
library(maptools)
library(highcharter)
library(geojsonio)
library(viridis)
```

## Data

The data used fhor this chart is the same using by Timo. But the workflow
was slightly modified:

1. Read the shapefile with `maptools::readShapeSpatial`.
2. Simplify the shapefile (optional step) using `rmapshaper::ms_simplify`.
3. Then transform the map data to geojson using `geojsonio::geojson_list`.


```{r}
map <- readShapeSpatial("data/thematicmap/gde-1-1-15.shp")
map <- ms_simplify(map, keep = 1) # because ms_simplify fix the Ã¼'s
map <- geojson_list(map)

str(map, max.level = 1)
str(map$features[[7]], max.level = 5)

# this was to put the name on the tooltip
map$features <- map(map$features, function(x) {
  x$properties$name <- x$properties[["Secondary_"]] 
  x
})

data <- read_csv("data/thematicmap/avg_age_15.csv")
data <- select(data, -X1)
data <- rename(data, value = avg_age_15)

# colors
no_classes <- 6

colors <- magma(no_classes + 2) %>% 
  rev() %>% 
  head(-1) %>% 
  tail(-1) %>% 
  gsub("FF$", "", .)

brks <- c(min(data$value), c(40,42,44,46,48), max(data$value))
brks <- ifelse(1:(no_classes + 1) < no_classes, floor(brks), ceiling(brks))
```

## Map

Create the raw map is straightforward. The _main_ challege was replicate the 
relief feature of the orignal map. This took _some days_ to figure
how add the backgound image. I did almost lost the hope but you know, new year,
so I tried a little more and it was possible :):

1. First I searched a way to transform the tif image to geojson. I wrote
a mail [@frzambra](https://twitter.com/frzambra) a geoRexpert :D. and
he kindly said me that I was wrong. And he was right. NEXT!
2. I tried with use `divBackgroundImage` but with this the image use all the
container... so... NEXT.
3. Finally surfing in the web I met `plotBackgroundImage` argument in highcharts
which is uesd to put and image only in plot container (inside de axis) and 
it works nicely. It was necessary hack the image using the `preserveAspectRatio`
(html world) to center the image but nothing magical. 

```{r, layout="l-page"}
urlimage <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbkunst/r-posts/master/061-beautiful-thematic-maps-with-ggplot2-highcharter-version
/02-relief-georef-clipped-resampled.jpg"

hc <- highchart(type = "map") %>% 
  # data part
  hc_add_series(mapData = map, data = data, type = "map",
                joinBy = c("BFS_ID", "bfs_id"), value = "value",
                borderWidth = 0) %>% 
  hc_colorAxis(dataClasses = color_classes(brks, colors)) %>% 
  # functionality
  hc_tooltip(headerFormat = "",
             pointFormat = "{point.name}: {point.value}",
             valueDecimals = 2) %>% 
  hc_legend(align = "right", verticalAlign = "bottom", layout = "vertical",
            floating = TRUE) %>%
  hc_mapNavigation(enabled = FALSE) %>% # if TRUE to zoom the relief image dont zoom.
  # info
  hc_title(text = "Switzerland's regional demographics") %>% 
  hc_subtitle(text = "Average age in Swiss municipalities, 2015") %>% 
  hc_credits(enabled = TRUE,
             text = "Map CC-BY-SA; Author: Joshua Kunst (@jbkunst) based mostly on Timo Grossenbacher (@grssnbchr) work, Geometries: ThemaKart, BFS; Data: BFS, 2016; Relief: swisstopo, 2016") %>% 
  # style
  hc_chart(plotBackgroundImage = urlimage,
           backgroundColor = "transparent",
           events = list(
             load = JS("function(){ $(\"image\")[0].setAttribute('preserveAspectRatio', 'xMidYMid') }")
           ))

Same as the original/ggplot2 version **but interactive**! I'm very happy with the result.
But anyway, there are some details:

1. The image/relief need to be accesible in web. I don't know how
to add images as dependencies yet. I tried econding the image but didn't work.
2. I could not do the legend same as the original. So I used `dataClasses`
instead of `stops` in `hc_colorAxis`.
