There are nice visualizations from chess data:
[piece movement](http://www.visualnews.com/2015/06/15/visualizing-the-movements-of-chess-pieces-using-millions-of-games/),
[piece survaviliy](https://github.com/ojb500/SurvivingPieces),
[square usage by player](http://en.chessbase.com/post/seth-kadish-visualizing-chess),
etc. Sadly not always the authors shows the code/data for replicate the final result.
So I wrote some code to show how to do some this great visualizations entirely in
R. Just for fun.

## The Data 

The original data come from [here](http://www.theweekinchess.com/chessnews/events/fide-world-cup-2015)
which was parsed and stored in the [rchess](http://github.com/jbkunst/rchess) package.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(rchess)

theme_set(
  theme_void(base_family = "Segoe UI") + 
    theme(legend.position = "none")
  )

data(chesswc)

chesswc

chesswc %>% 
  count(event)

chesswc <- chesswc %>% 
  filter(event == "FIDE World Cup 2015")
```

The most important variable here is the [pgn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) game.
This pgn is a long string which represent the game. However this format is not so visualization
friendly. That's why I implemented the `history_detail()` method for a `Chess` object. Let's check.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
pgn <- sample(chesswc$pgn, size = 1)
str_sub(pgn, 0, 50)
```

Compare the previous string with the first 10 rows of the `history_detail()`

```{r}
chss <- Chess$new()
chss$load_pgn(pgn)

chss$history_detail() %>%
  arrange(number_move)
```

The result is a dataframe where each row is a piece's movement showing explicitly the cells
where the travel in a particular number move. Now we apply this function over the 433
games in the FIDE World Cup 2015.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
chesswc <- chesswc %>%
  mutate(game_id = row_number())

library(furrr)
plan(multisession)

dfmoves <- chesswc %>% 
  select(game_id, pgn) %>% 
  mutate(
    data = future_map(pgn, function(p) {
      chss <- Chess$new()
      chss$load_pgn(p)
      chss$history_detail()
    })
  ) %>% select(-pgn) %>% 
  unnest()

# library(doParallel)
# workers <- makeCluster(parallel::detectCores())
# registerDoParallel(workers)
# moves <- plyr::llply(chesswc %>% pull(pgn), function(p) {
#   chss <- Chess$new()
#   chss$load_pgn(p)
#   chss$history_detail()
#   },  .parallel = TRUE, .paropts = list(.packages = c("rchess")))

dfmoves
```

The `dfmoves` data frame will be the heart from all these plots due have a lot of information and 
it is easy to consume.


## Piece Movements 

To try replicate the result it's necessary the data to represent (and then plot) the
board. In the rchess package there are some helper functions like `chessboardata()`.

```{r}
dfboard <- rchess:::.chessboarddata() %>%
  select(cell, col, row, x, y, cc)

dfboard
```

Now we add this information to the `dfmoves` data frame and calculates some field to 
to know how to draw the curves (see [here](http://rpubs.com/jbkunst/geom_curve) for more details).

```{r}
dfpaths <- dfmoves %>%
  left_join(
    dfboard %>% rename(from = cell, x.from = x, y.from = y),
    by = "from"
    ) %>%
  left_join(
    dfboard %>% rename(to = cell, x.to = x, y.to = y) %>% select(-cc, -col, -row),
    by = "to"
    ) %>%
  mutate(
    x_gt_y = abs(x.to - x.from) > abs(y.to - y.from),
    xy_sign = sign((x.to - x.from)*(y.to - y.from)) == 1,
    x_gt_y_equal_xy_sign = x_gt_y == xy_sign)
```

The data is ready! So we need now some `ggplot`, `geom_tile` for the board, the new `geom_curve`
to represent the piece's path and some `jitter` to make this more artistic. Let's
plot the f1 Bishop's movements.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_tile(data = dfboard, aes(x, y, fill = cc)) +
  geom_curve(data = dfpaths %>% filter(piece == "f1 Bishop", x_gt_y_equal_xy_sign),
             aes(x = x.from, y = y.from, xend = x.to, yend = y.to),
             position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.2),
             curvature = 0.50, angle = -45, alpha = 0.02, color = "white", size = 1.05) +
  geom_curve(data = dfpaths %>% filter(piece == "f1 Bishop", !x_gt_y_equal_xy_sign),
             aes(x = x.from, y = y.from, xend = x.to, yend = y.to),
             position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.2),
             curvature = -0.50, angle = 45, alpha = 0.02, color = "white", size = 1.05) +
  scale_fill_manual(values =  c("gray10", "gray20")) +
  ggtitle("f1 Bishop") +
  coord_equal()
```

In the same way we can plot every piece.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_tile(data = dfboard, aes(x, y, fill = cc)) +
  geom_curve(data = dfpaths %>% filter(piece == "g8 Knight", x_gt_y_equal_xy_sign),
             aes(x = x.from, y = y.from, xend = x.to, yend = y.to),
             position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.2),
             curvature = 0.50, angle = -45, alpha = 0.02, color = "black", size = 1.05) +
  geom_curve(data = dfpaths %>% filter(piece == "g8 Knight", !x_gt_y_equal_xy_sign),
             aes(x = x.from, y = y.from, xend = x.to, yend = y.to),
             position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.2),
             curvature = -0.50, angle = 45, alpha = 0.02, color = "black", size = 1.05) +
  scale_fill_manual(values =  c("gray80", "gray90")) +
  ggtitle("g8 Knight") +
  coord_equal() 
```

I think it's look very similar to the original work made by [Steve Tung](https://twitter.com/_tungs_).


## Survival Rates 

In this plot we need filter `dfmoves` by `!is.na(status)` so we can know what happend with
every piece in at the end of the game: if a piece was caputered of or not. Then get summary 
across all the games.

```{r}
dfsurvrates <- dfmoves %>%
  filter(!is.na(status)) %>%
  group_by(piece) %>%
  summarize(
    games = n(),
    was_captured = sum(status == "captured")
    ) %>%
  mutate(surv_rate = 1 - was_captured/games)

dfsurvrates %>%
  arrange(desc(surv_rate))
```

This helps as validation because the kings are never captured. Now we use a helper function in the
rchess package `rchess:::.chesspiecedata()` to get the start position for every piece and then plot
the survival rates in the cell where the piece start in the game.

```{r}
dfsurvrates <- dfsurvrates %>%
  left_join(rchess:::.chesspiecedata() %>% select(start_position, piece = name, color, unicode),
            by = "piece") %>%
  full_join(dfboard %>% rename(start_position = cell),
            by = "start_position")

# Auxiliar data to plot the board
dfboard2 <- data_frame(x = 0:8 + 0.5, y = 0 + 0.5, xend = 0:8 + 0.5, yend = 8 + 0.5)

ggplot(dfsurvrates) +
  geom_tile(data = dfsurvrates %>% filter(!is.na(surv_rate)),
            aes(x, y, fill = surv_rate)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "darkred",  high = "white") +
  geom_text(data = dfsurvrates %>% filter(!is.na(surv_rate)),
            aes(x, y, label = scales::percent(surv_rate)),
            color = "gray70", size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:8, labels = letters[1:8]) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:8, labels = 1:8)  +
  geom_segment(data = dfboard2, aes(x, y, xend = xend, yend = yend), color = "gray70") +
  geom_segment(data = dfboard2, aes(y, x, xend = yend, yend = xend), color = "gray70") +
  ggtitle("Survival Rates for each piece") + 
  coord_equal() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Obviously the plot show same data in text and color, and there a lot of space without
information but the idea is use the chess board to represent the initial position in a chess game.

We can replace the texts with the piece's icons:

```{r}
ggplot(dfsurvrates) +
  geom_tile(data = dfsurvrates %>% filter(!is.na(surv_rate)),
            aes(x, y, fill = 100*surv_rate)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(NULL, low = "darkred",  high = "white") +
  geom_text(data = dfsurvrates %>% filter(!is.na(surv_rate)),
            aes(x, y, label = unicode), size = 11, color = "gray20", alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:8, labels = letters[1:8]) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:8, labels = 1:8)  +
  geom_segment(data = dfboard2, aes(x, y, xend = xend, yend = yend), color = "gray70") +
  geom_segment(data = dfboard2, aes(y, x, xend = yend, yend = xend), color = "gray70") +
  ggtitle("Survival Rates for each piece") + 
  coord_equal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Square Usage By Player

For this visualization we will use the `to` variable. First of all we select the player
who have more games in the table `chesswc`. Then for each of them get the `to` counts.

```{r}
players <- chesswc %>% 
  count(white) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  pull(white) %>% 
  head(4)

players

dfmov_players <- map_df(players, function(p){ # p <- sample(players, size = 1)
  games <- chesswc %>% filter(white == p) %>% .$game_id
  dfres <- dfmoves %>%
    filter(game_id %in% games, !is.na(to)) %>%
    count(to) %>%
    mutate(player = p,
           p = n/length(games))
  dfres
})

dfmov_players <- dfmov_players %>%
  rename(cell = to) %>%
  left_join(dfboard, by = "cell")

ggplot(dfmov_players) +
  geom_tile(aes(x, row, fill = p)) +
  scale_fill_gradient("Movements to every cell\n(normalized by number of games)",
                      low = "white",  high = "darkblue") +
  geom_text(aes(x, row, label = round(p, 1)), size = 2, color = "white", alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~player) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:8, labels = letters[1:8]) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:8, labels = 1:8)  +
  geom_segment(data = dfboard2, aes(x, y, xend = xend, yend = yend), color = "gray70") +
  geom_segment(data = dfboard2, aes(y, x, xend = yend, yend = xend), color = "gray70") +
  coord_equal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Distributions For The First Movement 

Now, with the same data and using the `piece_number_move` and `number_move` we can obtain
the distribution for the first movement for each piece.

```{r, fig.height=4}
piece_lvls <- rchess:::.chesspiecedata() %>%
  mutate(col = str_extract(start_position, "\\w{1}"),
         row = str_extract(start_position, "\\d{1}")) %>%
  arrange(desc(row), col) %>%
  pull(name)

dfmoves_first_mvm <- dfmoves %>%
  mutate(piece = factor(piece, levels = piece_lvls),
         number_move_2 = ifelse(number_move %% 2 == 0, number_move/2, (number_move + 1)/2 )) %>%
  filter(piece_number_move == 1)

ggplot(dfmoves_first_mvm) +
  geom_density(aes(number_move_2), fill = "#B71C1C", alpha = 0.8, color = NA) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 20, 40), limits = c(0, 40)) + 
  facet_wrap(~piece, nrow = 4, ncol = 8, scales = "free_y")  +
  labs(x = "Number Move", y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 7) +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(hjust = 0))
```

Notice the similarities between the White King and h1 Rook due the castling, the same
effect is present between the Black King and the h8 Rook.


## Who Captures Whom 

For this plot we'll use the igraph package and [ForceAtlas2](https://github.com/analyxcompany/ForceAtlas2)
package an R implementation by [Adolfo Alvarez](http://adolfoalvarez.cl) of the Force Atlas 2 graph layout
designed for Gephi.

We get the rows with `status == "captured"` and summarize by `piece` and `captured_by` variables. The result data
frame will be the edges in our igraph  object using the `graph.data.frame` function.

```{r} 
library(igraph)
library(ForceAtlas2)

dfcaputures <- dfmoves %>%
  filter(status == "captured") %>%
  count(captured_by, piece) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

dfvertices <- rchess:::.chesspiecedata() %>%
  select(-fen, -start_position) %>%
  mutate(name2 = str_replace(name, " \\w+$", unicode),
         name2 = str_replace(name2, "White|Black", ""))

g <- graph.data.frame(dfcaputures %>% select(captured_by, piece, weight = n),
                      directed = TRUE,
                      vertices = dfvertices)

set.seed(123)
# lout <- layout.kamada.kawai(g)
lout <- layout.forceatlas2(g, iterations = 10000, plotstep = 0)

dfvertices <- dfvertices %>%
  mutate(x = lout[, 1], y = lout[, 2])

dfedges <- as_data_frame(g, "edges") %>%
  tbl_df() %>%
  left_join(dfvertices %>% select(from = name, x, y), by = "from") %>%
  left_join(dfvertices %>% select(to = name, xend = x, yend = y), by = "to")
```

To plot the the network I prefer use ggplot2 instead igraph just you get more control in the style
and colors.

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot() +
  geom_curve(data = dfedges %>%
               filter((str_extract(from, "\\d+") %in% c(1, 2) |
                         str_detect(from, "White"))),
             aes(x, y, xend = xend, yend = yend, alpha = weight, size = weight),
             curvature = 0.1, color = "red") +
  geom_curve(data = dfedges %>%
               filter(!(str_extract(from, "\\d+") %in% c(1, 2) |
                          str_detect(from, "White"))),
             aes(x, y, xend = xend, yend = yend, alpha = weight, size = weight),
             curvature = 0.1, color = "blue") +
  scale_alpha(range = c(0.01, 0.5)) +
  scale_size(range = c(0.01, 2)) +
  geom_point(data = dfvertices, aes(x, y, color = color), size = 15, alpha = 0.9) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("gray10", "gray90")) +
  geom_text(data = dfvertices %>% filter(str_length(name2) != 1),
            aes(x, y, label = name2), size = 5, color = "gray50") +
  geom_text(data = dfvertices %>% filter(str_length(name2) == 1),
            aes(x, y, label = name2), size = 9, color = "gray50") +
  ggtitle("Red: white captures black | Blue: black captures white") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

It's know we usually exchange pieces with the same values: queen by queen, knight by bishop, etc. The interesting
fact we see here is the d2 pawn/c7 pawn/g1 knight relationship because d2 pawn/c7 pawn is not so symmetrical and 
it's explained by the popular use the 
[Sicilian Opening](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e4/1...c5/2._Nf3/2...d6/3._d4/3...cxd4/4._Nxd4) 
in a master level (`1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4`).

I hope you enjoyed this post in the same way I enjoyed doing it :D. If you notice a mistake please let me know.
